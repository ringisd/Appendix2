## Video Demonstrations

We see the output of nine different values of k using the same clip, [Sports_1080P-19d8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ringisd/Appendix2/main/3x3.mp4). Each of these is a step in the Direct Optimiser search, with the centre being the unmodified codec, k=1 (bitrate = 240kbps) and centre left being the best performer with a bitrate of 159.34 kbps. These clips are at equal PSNR. 

One of the better performing clips, [Gaming_480P-6d1e](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ringisd/Appendix2/main/Great.mp4), where on the left is default with a bitrate of 122.7 kbps, and the right is using the best k from direct optimisation with 53.1 kbps. These are at equal PSNR.
